Specifically, we sought to analyze race and gender relations, with a focus on race-based spatial segregation.</p><p>This project employs a wide array of text analysis techniques including sentiment analysis, bigram and co-occurrence network analysis, and topic modeling. There was a significant amount of data cleaning involved since the data were human transcriptions of often poorly-photographed, messy handwritten responses to a wartime survey conducted over 75 years ago. </p><p>This past summer, I worked mostly on data cleaning and sentiment analysis. Specifically, I helped to neutralize racial bias in the NRC sentiment libraries and understand how negated bigrams impact sentiment. I have continued working on this project during my gap year where I have begun creating bigram and co-occurrence networks for a new survey and using BERT, a natural language processing library, for more advanced analyses. </p>","path":"/portfolio/projects/american_soldier","link":"https://dspg-young-scholars-program.github.io/dspg20amsoldier"},{"name":"The Impact of COVID-19 on the Equitable Delivery of Emergency Medical Services","short_desc":"Understanding the equitable distribution of Emergency Medical Services and the impact of COVID-19 on Charlottesville and Albermarle.","long_desc":"<p>In recent years, public health efforts have begun to focus increasingly on the social determinants of health as a means of understanding the prevailing health inequalities in the United States and across the world. While many of these determinants very clearly relate to population health (access to health care resources, for instance), others are more subtle in their health impacts, like residential segregation, education, and cultural values. The COVID-19 pandemic has only emphasized these prevailing patterns: while comprehensive studies are still underway, preliminary research indicates that Black Americans make up a significantly outsized portion of the hospitalizations related to COVID-19.</p><p>We partnered with Charlottesville City and Albemarle County, Virginia to understand the role that the delivery of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) plays in these historical and documented health disparities. We sought to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected EMS operations, and whether these changes may disproportionately impact certain populations in the Charlottesville area.</p><p>Using a database of EMS incidents in Charlottesville and Albemarle spanning the course of several years, we attempt to characterize the changes in call volume across the COVID-19 pandemic and identify any other potential patterns in EMS operations over the same time period. We also develop a model to predict EMS response times from various demographic variables in an attempt to understand whether disparities in service delivery exist for various populations. Finally, with significant input from local medical professionals, we attempt to use the data regularly recorded by EMS providers to identify potential COVID-19 cases in the dataset, and model change in the prevalence of this indicator across the pandemic.</p>","path":"/portfolio/projects/covid19_and_ems","link":"https://dspg-young-scholars-program.github.io/dspg20CharlottesvilleEMSEquity/"},{"name":"Minerva","short_desc":"Determining how collective action is mediated through social media.","long_desc":"<p>Sorry!
